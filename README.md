# FoodExplorer :

A responsive React.js app to browse food products with nutrition, ingredients, labels, category filtering, infinite scroll, and cart functionality.

## Features :

- View products from OpenFoodFacts API
- View product nutrition, labels, and ingredients
- Infinite scroll to load more products
- Search by name or barcode
- Filter by category & sort by name/nutrition
- Add to cart & view cart page (with delete & clear cart)

## Tech Stack :

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Axios
- React Context API (for cart state)

## Methodology :

I used:

- `axios` to fetch product data
- `IntersectionObserver` to implement infinite scroll
- `React Context API` to manage cart globally
- `openfoodfacts.org` API via `allorigins.win` proxy to bypass CORS
